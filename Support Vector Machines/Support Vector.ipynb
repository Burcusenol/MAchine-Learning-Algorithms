    "    * In an N-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of hyperplane dimension N-1.\n",
    "    For Example:\n",
    "        * 1-D Hyperplane is a single point\n",
    "        * 2-D Hyperplane is a line\n",
    "        * 3-D Hyperplane is flat plane\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main idea behind SVM is that we can use Hyperplanes to create a seperation betwwen classes.\n",
    "* Then new points will fall on one side of this seperating hyperplane,which we can then use to assign a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This same idea of maximum margins applies to N-dimensions.\n",
    "* Soft margin allows for misclassification inside the margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVMs use **kernels** to project the data to a higher dimension,in order to use a hyperplane in this higher dimension to separaae the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernel Intuition\n",
    "* Kernels allow us to move beyond a Support Vector Classifier and use Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a variety of kernles we can use to \"project\" the features to a higher dimension.\n"
